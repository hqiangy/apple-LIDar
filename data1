# Apple LiDAR Pavement Cracks Dataset

## Overview
This dataset contains pavement crack point clouds collected using Apple LiDAR on an iPad 21 Pro at Sun Yat-sen University, Zhuhai Campus. The dataset is intended for research on the potential application of Apple LiDAR in pavement crack detection.

## Data Collection Details
- **Device**: iPad 21 Pro  
- **Software**: SiteScape  
- **Point Cloud Density**: Premium  
- **Point Cloud Size**: Small  
- **File Format**: .ply  
- **Each File Represents**: A single crack  

## Crack Measurement Attributes
- **Measurement Tool**: A vernier caliper with a resolution of **0.01mm** was used to measure crack width and depth.  
- **Crack Type Annotation**: Crack types (**transverse, longitudinal, alligator, and block cracks**) were manually labeled based on visual inspection.  
- **Measurement Variability**: Due to different crack characteristics, some width measurements represent average values.  
- **Weather Conditions**: Data was collected during **light rain**, and the point cloud may include water accumulation in cracks.  
- **Measurement Consistency**: All measurements were conducted by the **same team** to ensure consistency.

## Usage Instructions
- **Viewing**: You can use CloudCompare, MeshLab, or Open3D to visualize and analyze the point cloud data.
- **Processing**: Python users can load the `.ply` files with Open3D:
  ```python
  import open3d as o3d
  pcd = o3d.io.read_point_cloud("crack_001.ply")
  o3d.visualization.draw_geometries([pcd])
  ```
